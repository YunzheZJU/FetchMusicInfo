# Here is the code I use in DAM A1.
# Created by Yunzhe @2017.9

## You can take use of main.py to fetch covers and introduction texts according to the .mp3 files in the dictionary.
## These data would be fetch from MoeGirl Wiki(for mainly ACG songs, in master branch) and BaiDu Wiki(for ordinary songs, in Baidu branch).
## removefilename.py can help you to clean the filenames and convert all .png files to .jpg files. Name of the songs would be moved to the first line of their introduction files(XXX.txt).

# Have fun!
